# Bluzelle - Scalable Data Services for dApps 


**WHAT IS IT?**

Bluzelle combines the sharing economy with the token economy - renting individuals' computer storage space to earn tokens while dApp developers use tokens to have their dApp's data stored and managed.

Bluzelle is a decentralized, on-demand, scalable database service for dApps. To ensure developers get the highest throughput in performance, reliability and scalability, Bluzelle implements swarming technologies.

A swarm is a large group of nodes (computers) that work together to store and manage data. Nodes in these swarms can go down and new nodes can come up with minimal impact on the network. 
Bluzelle fills a need to make the decentralized Internet complete, by improving efficiency and scale of data storage and management.

Bluzelle is NOT a blockchain. Blockchains, at the risk of giving a circular answer, are chains of blocks of data. Bluzelle is a database, and conceptually, not too different from common NoSQL databases. 

Blockchain data is immutable (can never be changed), and blockchains generally grow monotonically (some blockchains can be pruned). Blockchains also typically require some sort of proof in order to maintain integrity of the information contained within and reach global consensus, usually via proof of stake or proof of work.

**WHY IT MATTERS**

  Straight from the Developers' mouths, Bluzelle is changing the game. To put it in better words would be a feat nearly unattainable, so I'll leave you to a quote directly from the Bluzelle Team.
>The new decentralized internet is missing a major component — a database service.

>There’s rapid innovation in blockchain and frenetic activity in the decentralized storage space, in particular, thanks to IPFS/Filecoin, Storj, Sia, and Ethereum’s Swarm. But these solutions can only progress the decentralized so far.

>Bluzelle fills a key gap in decentralised infrastructure. Whenever we are asked what is Bluzelle’s differentiator — and we get the question a lot — the answer is simple:

>Bluzelle is a database service while the rest of these are file services.”

>Bluzelle is a quick, cheap and scalable decentralized database service ready for the world’s dApps.
     
Now on top of all this, they've just launched an ICO with huge success in the area of $19.5 Million. 

They generated the amount after putting 165 million tokens for sale within 24 hours.

Bluzelle closed its three-day Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in January with $19.5 million in fresh funding.

Bluzelle's ICO veered away from "Fear of Missing Out" or FOMO tactics and instead gave buyers 24 hours to purchase the 165 million tokens made available for sale.

The 165 million tokens sold is 33% of the 500 million generated by Bluzelle.

Amongst the database provider's investors include Kenetic Capital, Hashed, Kryptonite 1 and 8 Decimal Capital.

The Singapore-based firm's decentralized database is a pioneer in data storage and management systems for the decentralized internet. It solves dApp developers' need for data storage and management systems that are flexible enough to allow fast and simple data queries on decentralized internet.

**HOW IT WORKS**

Straight from the White-Paper, the easiest and most thorough explanation of how Bluzelle actually works:

>Using concepts taken from NoSQL (non-relational SQL), Bluzelle's first incarnation is a keyvalue storage that exploits horizontal data sharding partitioning concepts to split databases, irrespective of size, into smaller, faster, and more easily managed parts called data shards (shard means "a small part of a whole"). 


>Bluzelle takes this concept and marries it with blockchain concepts to create a powerful economy of producers and consumers. In modern nomenclature, it a crypto-economic network. In later versions, vertical partitioning will be added, with the ability for the consumer to direct how and where partitioning occurs on both axis’.


     
**WHO IT AFFECTS**

Generally speaking, Bluzelle affects every Internet user who intends to step into the new age of Internet and data storage services.

One group of people this partiularly affects in a positive manner, are those who have previously stored data on the extremely expensive Ethereum network, and those who previously supported FileCoin. From their whitepaper: 

> The producers (aka farmers or miners) provide resources in the form of CPU processing power, memory, permanent storage, and network connectivity to enable database shards to be stored with sufficient partial replication across a swarm of swarms of nodes (a metaswarm) to guarantee availability and redundancy. In later versions of Bluzelle, a smaller, proportional “stake” will be put up as collateral by a producer as an incentive for them to guarantee reliability. The stake can be proportionally lost, if sufficient metrics are not met.


> Consumers use Bluzelle's database services provided by the collective whole (all the producers), and in turn pay for the services using the Bluzelle ERC-20 Token (BLZ) and Bluzelle Native Token (BNT) . They have control over attributes that dictate how and where their data is stored, that will affect the BNT cost for these services.
Initial peer data needed for new nodes or client applications to bootstrap themselves with
Bluzelle uses the Ethereum blockchain (a pre-existing decentralized network) as a basis to get all associated data in a reliable, scalable, and low-cost way. This approach does not reduce the degree of decentralization of Bluzelle


We all know the Ethereum Network is extremely expensive to store data. If you would like to see a specific example firsthand, follow this link: [Gas Usage Example] (https://medium.com/@didil/off-chain-data-storage-ethereum-ipfs-570e030432cf)


 **FINAL WORDS**

 To wrap up on Bluzelle's features and intended path, I'll add some photos showing the features of Bluelle, and their intended use of funds/tokn distribution.

 With Bluzelle having nearly zero solid competitors, large upside potential and little downside, they seem to be paving the future for decentralized data storage.

Between bringing together so many talented minds, coming off a hugely successful ICO, and providing a service that could finally solve data storage problems efficiently, cheaply, and securely, Bluzelle has stamped their name on the market, hard.

I think it's safe to say Bluzelle is a team to watch, and you certainly don't want to miss the future in store for them.
